# Athabasca University Assessment

This project was built using Angular CLI 8.0+ which requires Node.js `v10.9` or greater.  I built and tested it on a laptop running node `v10.16.0 LTS`, with Angular CLI installed globally.  I also deployed and tested it on a separate machine running node `v12.4.0` without a global Angular CLI installation.

## Build

Run `npm install` and `ng build` in the root of the folder to build the project.  If you do not have Angular CLI installed (`ng` command is not recognized), you can run `npx ng build`, as the Angular CLI 8 is included as a dev dependency with the project.  

## Run on dev server

Run `ng serve` to run the app on a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
